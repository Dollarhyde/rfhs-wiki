# RF CTF RFID NFC Challenges

This should be considered a general list with general information for in person RFID/NFC challenges.

All challenges are subject to change and may be available only if the code or equipment is working.
Please check with staff if you have any questions.

## In Person
All challenges are currently only available in person.  We hope to add virtual RFID/NFC challenges in the future.  Good luck!

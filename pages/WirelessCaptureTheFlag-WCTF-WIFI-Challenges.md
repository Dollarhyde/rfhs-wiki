These instructions were written by a drunk developer after not sleeping for 2 days. Create an account on our scoreboard: https://scoreboard.wctf.us/ Once you are logged in, click the heading with your user name. Follow the directions to provision a new vm (below modifying user settings, above the user scoreboard). These directions will improve with time and sleep.

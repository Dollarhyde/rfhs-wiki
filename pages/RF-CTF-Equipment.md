## LRS Pagers
Long Range Systems manufacture several versions of pagers and paging devices. At the table you may notice something similar to the on in this image:

Each pager is similar to what you would find at a restaurant. Check the scoreboard for what challenges are live, but if you see this you might need to receive and or transmit packets to and from these devices. LRS usually involves a restaurant id, and a pager id. These numbers are useful and you should figure out how to find them and use them

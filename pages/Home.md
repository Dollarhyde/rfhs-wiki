## Mission of the Wiki

No one person knows everything.  We are a community of very smart, motivated, and passionate people who do our very best when we help each other.  This wiki will be for everyone to use and contribute to.  There are so many people, so much research, and so many sources of information that a team effort is required to bring it all together so that we can all benefit.

# RF-CTF-Magic-Mixies

## Info

For ShmooCon 2023, the RF-CTF is introducing a new challenge. In the room, there will be a [Magic Mixies Crystal Ball](https://www.moosetoys.com/magic-mixies/magic-mixies-crystal-ball/). This crystal ball is controlled by a magic wand, as shown in the [Magic Mixies Crystal Ball Instructional Video](https://youtu.be/b-J_5wsfhqY?t=47).

In order to complete the RF-CTF Magic Mixies challenge, your task is to reveal the Magic Mixie within the crystal ball, without using the magic wand to do so. Don't forget to say the magic words when casting your spells!

You may borrow the magic wand to analyze the signals that it emits, however you may not disassemble the wand or the base. You may not handle or interact with the crystal ball base; the wand contains all of the important information to cast spells to the crystal ball. When you think you have all of the information you need from the wand, return the wand to the RFHS staff, and indicate that you are ready to complete the challenge. The RFHS staff will activate the crystal ball, and your task will be to trigger the crystal ball to reveal its Magic Mixie without using the magic wand to do so. Once you successfully reveal the Magic Mixie, the RFHS staff will award points for successfully completing the Magic Mixie challenge.

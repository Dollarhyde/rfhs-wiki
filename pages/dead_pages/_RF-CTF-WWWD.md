## Game Play
 
We won't all be in the same place for Def Con 29 again this year so the world is your oyster, but choose your quadrant carefully.   The full rules for how to pick a quadrant and how the wardriving data is scored is available on the sign up page (linked from above).
 
The total available points for the war drive is 2500 points. These points will be distributed as a percentage of the total to the players that submit to the challenge. Remember the AP only counts the first time it is submitted, so submit early and often. The second time it is submitted will not count to that player.  Within the areas that each of the players has chosen there are "foxes", and these foxes increase your score multiplier to enhance your total.  The amount of foxes in an area are based on the QoS of that area and are points in the WiGLE dataset observed recently and often enough that we believe you will be able to find it if you cover the area you've subscribed to.
Points are given for new APs found that have been verified in a quadrant over the amount in that area before you started driving that area. This as a percentage also factors in to your total points. The points from the World Wide Wardrive alone may not be enough to force a win, but will very likely be a factor in the final RF CTF scoring.

The main RF CTF scoreboard (https://scoreboard.rfhackers.com) will not include points from the WWWD until after the WWWD closes (one hour before the RF CTF)

We are now RF HACKERS SANCTUARY

Welcome to the new normal of virtual greatness

We have virtualized our environment and have had to make a few modifications but you can expect to see the following:

### SDR Challenges
* You will run some scripts from our github [SDR TOOLS](https://github.com/rfhs/wctf-sdr-tools/)
* To be fair things may be a little easier in some ways and sigidwiki will be very helpful
* We are using ZMQ this year to give you as close to real world as possible

### What now?

* make an account
* make a team or join a team
* have fun and learn

### Scoreboard
To score you will need to submit flags:

Which will be the passphrases used to gain access to wireless access points.

Challenges do not have to be solved in order.  Difficulty ranges from easy to insane.  Donâ€™t dwell on only one problem


you supply your own internet
we can see you, so be careful

### Background:
The Virtual Foxhunt uses simulated transmitters and receivers. You are provided with receiver location and signal angle of arrival data. Your task is to collect and process that data to determine the location of the transmitter.

The easy version of this challenge will require some basic math and will allow you simply draw lines on a map to locate the target. The intermediate and hard versions of this challenge deal with moving receivers and transmitters, therefore you'll be required to aggregate and analyze the data.

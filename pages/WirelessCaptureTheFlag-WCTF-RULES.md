WirelessCaptureTheFlag Rules

The first rule of WCTF Club is to have fun and learn.

Both offense and Defense are in scope.

If you are caught doing anything bad the WCTF Team will punish with extreme prejudice in any and every way they feel required and it won't be fair.

Follow all local, state, and Federal Rules.

Follow the rules of the Conference and Conference Venue.

Points do not transfer from team to team if you change teams.

We reserve the right to retire a team or competitor at any time.  This is based on superior performance or poor and bad behaviour.

**Don't make us make more rules.**

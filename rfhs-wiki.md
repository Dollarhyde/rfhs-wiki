# General Use
## 802.11 Wireless Standard
The wireless local area network (WLAN) Wi-Fi is the [IEEE 802.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11) standard within the overall [IEEE 802](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802) standards family. The working group for the 802.11 WLAN standards can be found [here](http://www.ieee802.org/11/).

More information can be found directly from the [IEEE](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_11-2016.html) Standards Association itself.

## Education
The aircrack-ng.org website contains the well-known wireless auditing methods for learning the aircrack-ng toolsuite including the [Getting Started](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=getting_started) guide to the [Simple WEP Crack](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=simple_wep_crack), and more.

[Wasabi](https://twitter.com/FrustratedITGuy), a member of the crew, has shared knowledge and provides [recorded sessions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJhlW698__Zic9y3Jc3T99w/featured) of the preparation needed prior to competing in the Wireless CTF. He also shares his interests with his [playlists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJhlW698__Zic9y3Jc3T99w/playlists) for your entertainment.

## Certification
While there is an abundance of knowledge that can be found, there are also certifications to demonstrate the Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) acquired to establishing yourself as a wireless security professional.

### CWNA® - Certified Wireless Network Administrator
[CWNA® - Certified Wireless Network Administrator](https://www.cwnp.com/certifications/cwna) is a foundational level wireless LAN certification provided by the [Certified Wireless Professional Network](https://www.cwnp.com/). There are non-mandatory prerequisite certifications, such as the [Certified Wireless Specialist (CWS)](https://www.cwnp.com/certifications/cws-100/) and the [Certified Wireless Technician (CWT)](https://www.cwnp.com/certifications/cwt-100/) that provide learning and foundational that are recommended before the CWNA.

The CWNA course material covers the following domains:
Radio Frequency (RF) Technologies:

* Antenna Concepts
* Wireless LAN Hardware and Software
* Network Design, Installation, and Management
* Wireless Standards and Organizations
* 802.11 Network Architecture
* Wireless LAN Security
* Troubleshooting
* How to Perform Site Surveys

### Offensive Security Wireless Professional
The [Offensive Security Wireless Professional (OSWP)](https://www.offensive-security.com/wifu-oswp/) is a wireless security auditing certification provided by [Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/). Before scheduling the exam, the individual must first complete the lab assignments with the Offensive Security Wireless Attacks (WiFu).

The WiFu lab course materials and OSWP cover the essential tools and auditing methods:

* IEEE 802.11
* Wireless Networks
* Packets and Network Interaction
* Linux Wireless Stack and Drivers
* Aircrack-ng Essentials
* Cracking WEP with Connected Clients
* Cracking WEP via a Client
* Cracking Clientless WEP Networks
* Bypassing WEP Shared Key Authentication
* Cracking WPA/WPA2 PSK with Aircrack-ng
* Cracking WPA with JTR and Aircrack-ng
* Cracking WPA with coWPAtty
* Cracking WPA with Pyrit
* Additional Aircrack-ng Tools
* Wireless Reconnaissance
* Rogue Access Points
